## Installation

TUHub for iOS uses Cocoapods. [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 1.2.0+ is required to build TUHub.

After installing Cocoapods, run the following command in TUHub's root directory:

```bash
$ pod install
```

Once completed, open TUHub.xcworkspace in Xcode. Build and run to execute the program on your selected iOS simulator or device using âŒ˜ + R.
